        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 vanilla bean</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons <strong>unflavored</strong> powdered gelatin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed berries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients (you won't need the berries until you're ready to serve the finished panna cotta).</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, sugar, vanilla bean, and seeds. Bring the mixture just to a simmer over moderate heat. Remove from the heat, cover, and let steep for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let stand until evenly moistened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the cream mixture and bring just to a simmer over moderately high heat. Remove from heat, add the gelatin, and stir until dissolved. Remove the vanilla bean and save for another use.</li>
            <li>Pour the panna cotta mixture into eight 4-ounce ramekins and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the panna cotta is set but still jiggly, at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Serve in the ramekins with berries.</li>
        </ol>
