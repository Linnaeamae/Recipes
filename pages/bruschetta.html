        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1pound plum tomatoes (about 4 to 5 large), or another variety of ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 larger garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>8 large basil leaves</li>
            <li>Grilled or toasted crusty bread, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Core and chop the tomatoes, then transfer to a colander over a bowl or in the sink. Add the salt and gently stir. Let drain for up to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil and garlic over low heat until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesnâ€™t brown. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Roll the basil leaves up and thinly slice crosswise.</li>
            <li>When the oil is cool and the tomatoes are well drained, combine the tomatoes, garlic oil and basil in a medium bowl. Season with additional salt, to taste. Spoon over toasted bread.</li>
        </ol>
