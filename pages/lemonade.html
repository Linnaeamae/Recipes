            <p>
                Lemonade is always a great treat to make in the summer. Whether its for a day by the pool, a family picnic or just to have while you watch tv.
                Many people might believe that its not worth the effort to make lemonade from scratch, but this recipe will change their mind!
                The freshly squeezed lemons make the drink much tangier and bright. You will never want store-bought again.
